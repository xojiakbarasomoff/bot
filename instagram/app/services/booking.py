"""Letting the assistant offer a real free slot and book it.

Asked to book an appointment, the assistant used to ask for a phone number
so that somebody would call back. That is a worse answer than the clinic can
actually give: the schedule is right here, the free slots are known, and the
patient is already typing. A receptionist would say "bugun 14:00 bo'sh,
to'g'ri keladimi?" -- so this makes that answer possible.

Two halves, and the split is deliberate.

Reading: before the model is asked anything, the real free slots are looked
up and written into the prompt as facts. The model never computes
availability, never guesses a time, and cannot offer a slot that is taken --
it picks from a list it was handed. This is also what lets it answer "when
are you free?", because it is holding the whole week rather than one
suggestion.

Writing: the model marks the slot the patient accepted with
[[BOOK:YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM]] at the end of its reply. The marker is stripped
before the patient sees anything, the slot is re-checked against the
database, and only then is the appointment created.

A marker rather than tool calling, because LLMProvider is text in, text out
across three providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Qwen through Hugging Face) and each
speaks a different tool protocol. One marker works identically on all three,
in a single call -- which matters when the deployment's whole daily
allowance is measured in tens of replies.

The honest weakness is the gap between offering a slot and writing the row:
another booking can land in between. It is re-checked at write time and
never double-booked -- the database's partial unique index is the real
guard -- but by then the reply has already been written, so a lost race is
answered with a fixed correction rather than by asking the model again.
That costs a call this deployment may not have, and the race is rare in a
single clinic; the alternative, telling a patient they are booked when they
are not, is the one failure that ends with somebody standing in a waiting
room.
